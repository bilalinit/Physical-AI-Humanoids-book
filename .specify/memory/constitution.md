# Docusaurus RAG Chatbot Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Service Isolation & Distinct Runtimes
The architecture is strictly tri-fold: **Frontend (Docusaurus/React)**, **Backend (FastAPI/Python)**, and **Auth Server (Node/Express)**. These must remain decoupled. **Rule:** No direct database access from the Frontend. **Rule:** The Frontend serves static content; dynamic features (Chat, Auth) must occur via REST API calls. **Rule:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) must be explicitly configured to allow communication between ports 3000, 3001, and 8000 (and production equivalents).

### II. Guardrailed Intelligence
AI interactions must never directly expose the raw LLM to the user without mediation. **Rule:** All chat requests must pass through the `openai-agents` Guardrail layer. **Rule:** Every query must be evaluated for **Content Safety** (Pornography/Politics) and **Topic Relevance** (Book-related vs. General) before generation. **Rule:** RAG retrieval (Qdrant) must occur *before* LLM generation to ground the response in factual data.

### III. Profile-Driven Personalization
The chatbot is not generic; it is a tutor that adapts to the user. **Rule:** User background data (Education, Software/Hardware exp) collected during Auth **must** be injected into the System Prompt for every RAG query. **Rule:** If a user is unauthenticated, the system must default to a "General/Beginner" profile but still function for basic queries (if allowed) or prompt for login.

### IV. Truth in Markdown (Vector Synchronization)
The source of truth for knowledge is the `.md` files in the `docs/` directory. **Rule:** The Qdrant vector database is a derivative of the Markdown files. **Rule:** Any content update to documentation requires running the `ingest.py` script to maintain synchronization between the static site and the AI brain. **Rule:** Chunking strategies must preserve context (approx. 1000 chars) to ensure retrieval quality.

### V. Secure Identity Propagation
Authentication and Authorization are handled centrally but verified locally. **Rule:** The **Auth Server** (Better Auth) is the single source of truth for identity. **Rule:** The **Backend** must validate JWTs (from Headers or Cookies) independently before processing chat requests. **Rule:** Secrets (API Keys, DB URLs) must strictly reside in `.env` files and never be committed to version control.

### VI. Development Workflow Standards
All development follows a strict tri-service architecture pattern. **Rule:** Developers must run Frontend (:3000), Auth (:3001), and Backend (:8000) simultaneously during local development. **Rule:** Before testing RAG functionality, the `ingest.py` script must be run against the local `docs/` folder. **Rule:** Environment synchronization requires `.env` files present in all three service roots based on `.env.example`.

## Technology Standards
**Stack Requirements:** **Frontend:** Docusaurus 3.x, React 19, TypeScript 5.x. **Backend:** Python 3.12+ (managed via `uv`), FastAPI. **Auth:** Node.js 20+, Better Auth, Express. **Databases:** PostgreSQL (User/Chat History), Qdrant (Vectors). **AI Provider:** Google Gemini (via OpenAI-compatible adapter). **Directory & Structure:** `backend/`: Python logic, Ingestion scripts, API. `auth-server/`: Node.js Better Auth implementation. `test-docs/`: Docusaurus site (Frontend). Migrations must be stored in their respective service directories (e.g., `auth-server/migrations/`).

## Development Workflow
**Local Development:** 1. **Triple-Terminal Setup:** Developers must run Frontend (:3000), Auth (:3001), and Backend (:8000) simultaneously. 2. **Ingestion First:** Before testing RAG, the `ingest.py` script must be run against the local `docs/` folder. 3. **Environment Sync:** `.env` files must be present in all three service roots based on `.env.example`. **Deployment Gates:** 1. **Build Check:** The Docusaurus build (`npm run build`) must pass without broken links (`onBrokenLinks: 'throw'`). 2. **Linting:** TypeScript types must check out in both Frontend and Auth server. 3. **Migration Check:** Database schema changes must be applied via SQL scripts before code deployment.

## Governance
**Amendment Process:** This Constitution defines the architectural integrity of the RAG Chatbot. Changes to the **Database Schema** (Postgres or Qdrant) require updating Section 8 of the Specifications. Changes to the **API Contract** (between Frontend and Backend) require updating Section 9 of the Specifications. **Compliance:** Pull Requests must verify that no "Direct to LLM" calls exist; all must route through the RAG/Guardrail pipeline. Frontend components must treat `apiUrl` as a prop/env variable to ensure compatibility with GitHub Pages (where the backend URL differs from localhost).
