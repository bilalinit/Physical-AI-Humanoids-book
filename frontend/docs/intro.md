# Docusaurus Book for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide for building embodied intelligence systems that bridge modern generative AI with hard robotics. This documentation provides a complete educational resource for CS/Robotics Engineering Students, covering everything from hardware setup to autonomous humanoid systems using NVIDIA's ecosystem.

## Overview

This book is organized into six parts with twelve chapters, designed to take you from basic infrastructure setup to advanced autonomous humanoid systems:

1. **Infrastructure**: Hardware, OS, and development environment setup
2. **ROS Nervous System**: Robot Operating System architecture and kinematics
3. **Digital Twin**: Simulation with Gazebo and Isaac Sim
4. **Perception & Navigation**: Sensors, VSLAM, and navigation
5. **VLA Integration**: Vision-Language-Action systems
6. **Capstone**: Complete autonomous humanoid implementation

## Target Audience

This documentation is specifically designed for:
- CS/Robotics Engineering Students
- Researchers working with embodied AI
- Engineers developing humanoid robots
- Anyone interested in the intersection of AI and robotics

## How to Use This Book

Each chapter builds on previous concepts but can also be read independently for specific topics. We recommend following the parts sequentially for a comprehensive understanding, but you can also jump to specific chapters based on your needs.

All code examples are tested and designed to work with NVIDIA's ecosystem, including Jetson platforms, Isaac Sim, and the complete ROS 2 toolchain.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (Python, C++)
- Understanding of robotics concepts
- Access to appropriate hardware (NVIDIA Jetson, etc.) or simulation environment
